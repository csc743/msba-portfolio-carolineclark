In our MSBA 635 case competition, the company TruSource is experiencing customer churn which harms revenue and growth. The goal of this project was to analyze customer behavior data to identify patterns that predict churn. By detecting early signs, the company can work to target at-risk customers with retention efforts.

Results
 - Identified key churn drivers including short tenure.
 - Built a predictive model that identifies customers based on whether they are likely to churn.
 - Created clear insights for retention efforts for TruSource.

How to Run Code
