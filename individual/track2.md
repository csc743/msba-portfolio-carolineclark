A recommendation created by our team was to target people in cluster 0 which is people in early life-span. We will improve retention by offering a price lock or add on service if they customer switches to month to month payments. The sucess metric would be reduction in customer churn among early tenure customers who recieve the offer. Based on our dataset, the base customer churn for early customers was 53.50%.A metric we would not want to worsen is number of yearly payers since this is proven to increase risk of churn. We could test and measure the impact of this by having a control and test group. One set of early lifespan customers would recieve the incentive, while the other group wouldnt. Then, we would compare the groups after a period of time, which would be a year. Two consequences could be customers choosing the plan just for the incentive, leading to profit loss. There is also a risk that the incentive could cost the company overall more than what is being lost from churn.
