Individual Contribution
  For the case competition, I personally contributed most to the presentation making, 
  making sure it was appealing to the audience while being precise and clear and aesthetically pleasing.
  Also, I helped with the problem framing portions of the project and supported my teammates more code focused by
  looking at their methods and running them on my own to see how they preformed.
  Last, I helped identify variables related to customer churn and what we actually need to predict within the models. 
  One approach I strongly advocated for was focusing on making a presentation that would stand out but also portray 
  our data analysis concisely. I have a lot of experience with creating meaningful presentations and 
  I feel as if this helped with the Customer Churn case.
  Two lessons I learned from this case competition is that I seem to learn better with application such as this project, 
  and that communication is key to group work. Some of my team members had more modeling experience than I did, so 
  learning from them and asking questions about their methods actually helped me learn so much and for that, I am so thankful
  for them. Our team had really great communcation which helped the project move smoothly and everyone feel
  involved in their own way. If I had more time, I would have tried to personally make my own models
  so that I can make them without any help in the future. This would increase my knowledge of creating models
  by doing them on my own.
